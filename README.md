# Sumocli

Sumocli is a CLI application that provides the ability to interact with the Sumo Logic public API from your local machine command line or a CI/CD pipeline. I choose to build this application for two reasons:

1. I wanted to have my entire Sumo Logic configuration deployed through a CI/CD pipeline
2. I wanted to learn more about Golang

I decided to open source this project as other people in the Sumo Logic community may find this useful and solve some problems they may have.
